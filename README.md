# DataAnalysis
Some tools that I have written/am writing for data analysis for my physics practicals
## Linear Fit
Linear fit fits a data set formatted as data = {x:[y, error in y]} linearly giving minimum and maximum gradients given the individual errors in the y values. It should then self correct but I have not had time to test this functionality yet.
